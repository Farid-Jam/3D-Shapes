# üßä Cube-3D
**Cube3D** is a simple 3D cube viewer and renderer implemented in C using the SDL2 library. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics including projection, face culling, rotation, and lighting, all powered by complex linear algebra and trigonometry 

## ‚ú® Features
- Perspective projection  
- Mouse-controlled 3D rotation  
- Back-face culling toggle (`c` key)  
- Solid face rendering toggle (`f` key)  
- Dynamic lighting via dot product  
- Resizable SDL window

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
### Requirements
 - SDL2
 - GCC or any C compiler

### Compilation
```bash
make
```

### Run
```bash
./Cube3D
```

## Controls
| Key/Input | Action                   |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `f`       | toggle filled face mode  |
| `c`       | toggle back-face culling |
| Mouse     | Rotate cube              |

## üß† How it Works
- 3D points are rotated around the x and y axises respectively using rotational matrices
- Projection is performed using a perspective projection formula
- Back-face culling is determined via the dot product between a faces normal and the view direction
- Fill mode renders faces as two triangles and fills them through scanline rendering
- Shading is dot-product-based, using the dot product between a faces normal and the view direction
