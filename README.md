# üßä Cube-3D
**Cube3D** is a simple 3D cube viewer and renderer implemented in C using the SDL2 library. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of 3D graphics including projection, face culling, rotation, and lighting, all possible via extensive linear algebra and trigonometry 

## ‚ú® Features
- Perspective projection
- Mouse-controlled 3D rotation
- Back-face culling toogle (`c` key)
- Solid face rendering toggle (`f` key)
- Dynamic lighting via dot product
- Resizable SDL window
